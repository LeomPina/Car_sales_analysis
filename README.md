# Car_sales_analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to offer a thourough analysis and insight on a car sales dataset, in order to help a client with the decision of buying a new car, by building a suitable model for used car prices
and some other relevant details, such as the likelihood of a car being sold by the first owner. Data preparation, cleaning, EDA, and modelling tasks were performed by using the different car features to give a detailed dataset analysis review.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "car-analysis-data.rda" dataset, containing detailed information about different cars for sale.

### Tools
-RStudio

### Libraries
-validate

-ggplot2

-tree

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

During the data cleaning and preparation steps, we addressed the following possible issues:

1. Incoherent values

2. Outliers

3. Duplicated Rows

4. Missing Values

5. Typos

6. Wrong variable types

### Exploratory Data Analysis

By performing EDA on the chosen dataset, we studied the following aspects:

1. Graphical data visualisation of the data

2. Evaluate skewness

3. Chosing our dependent variable

4. Study the relation between numerical variables (Scatter-plot, Cor-test)

5. Study the relation between numerical and categorical variables (Boxplot, t-test)
   
6. Study the relation between numerical and logical variables (Boxplot, ANOVA)

### Modelling

When building the models to study certain user questions, we used the following methods:

1. Linear regression model

2. Logistic regression model
