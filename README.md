# Car_sales_analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to offer a thourough analysis and insight on a car sales dataset, in order to help a client with the decision of buying a new car, by building a suitable model for used car prices
and some other relevant details, such as the likelihood of a car being sold by the first owner. Data preparation, cleaning, EDA, and modelling tasks were performed by using the different car features to give a detailed dataset analysis review.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "car-analysis-data.rda" dataset, containing detailed information about different cars for sale.

### Tools
-RStudio

### Libraries
-validate

-ggplot2

-tree

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

During the data cleaning and preparation steps, we addressed the following issues:

1.Incoherent values

2.Outliers

3.Duplicated Rows

4.Missing Values

5.Typos

6.Wrong variable types

### Exploratory Data Analysis

By performing EDA on the chosen dataset, we studied the following aspects:

1.Graphical data visualisation of the data

2. Chosing our dependent variable

3. 

### Modelling
